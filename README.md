Windows 11 Taskbar Clone
This project is a clone of the Windows 11 taskbar, designed to mimic the layout and functionality of the taskbar in Windows 11. It includes features such as a weather display, system tray icons, and taskbar items with hover effects. The taskbar is created using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript to handle some interactivity.

Features
Weather Display: Displays the current temperature and weather condition on the left side of the taskbar.

Taskbar Icons: Includes icons like Start, Search, Microsoft Store, and more, similar to Windows 11.

Clock & Date: Displays the current time and date on the right side of the taskbar.

Responsive Design: The taskbar adjusts to different screen sizes for a more adaptive layout.

Hover Effects: Icons have subtle hover effects for interactivity.
